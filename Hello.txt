Hello

Please DO NOT send me messages via github's "issues" system, linkedin comments/discussion,
stackoverflow questions, google+, and any other Web 3.0 "coolness". (The issues system does
have an email interface, but it is not a substitute for email. I can't cc anyone else when I
want to, for instance. Well I can, but any response the original requester then makes using the
website will not get cc-d to the person I cc-d).

Ciao!
